 With two add-on features:

 1. **Frenzied Sheep:**  Sheep now move in unpredictable, wiggling paths. A "logic wall" system was implemented to check their position and force them to turn around at the screen edges, keeping them in the play area.

 2. **Persistent Mute Button:**  A global mute button with a dynamic icon was added to the UI. This setting is persistent, meaning it's remembered when the player moves between the Title and Game scenes.
